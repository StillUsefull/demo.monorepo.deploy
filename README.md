# OTG


## Start the app (front-end and back-end)

To start the development server run `npm run start:dev:all`.


To start the development front-end app run `npm run start:dev:frontend`.


To start the development back-end app run `npm run start:dev:backend`.


## Want better Editor Integration?

Have a look at the [Nx Console extensions](https://nx.dev/nx-console). It provides autocomplete support, a UI for exploring and running tasks & generators, and more! Available for VSCode, IntelliJ and comes with a LSP for Vim users.

## Ready to deploy?

Just run `nx build demoapp` to build the application. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory, ready to be deployed.

## Set up CI!

Nx comes with local caching already built-in (check your `nx.json`). On CI you might want to go a step further.
